## Developing projects all hands on deck is my prefered way of learning 🛫

  ## What I'm doing right now:

  ### - Doing an Internship as a Laravel fullstack developer
  ### - Focusing on developing web-apps as a fullstack developer and learning as many tools of the trade as possible. 
  ### - Working on two Django projects and a Godot game!

  ## Bio:

I'm a software developer from Brazil. I started my programming studies in 2022 by doing CS50 from Harvard by sheer curiosity as I've been a computer nerd for decades. Now I am working towards a degree in Curitiba, Brazil, and working on as many projects as I can to learn fast. 

I am currently focusing on developing web apps as fullstack web developer. I've got a good hang on Laravel and Django for backend development and with TailwindCSS for front-end tasks. I am also familiar, to a lesser degree, with C# and Java and I can also model and work with relational databases. My goal is to understand the whole proccess of developing and mantaining a full application, from starting a project on a solid foundation up to deploying it and scaling.

At the time of writing, I am doing an internship were I build fullstack web applications with Laravel for internal use at a tech support sector in a national company. On top of that, I'm working on two personal projects using Django and and on a game on Godot with GDscript. 

Ah! I also happen to have a degree in music production where I graduated as top of my class, in 2022! 🎺
