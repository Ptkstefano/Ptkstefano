### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Brazil. I started my studies in 2022 by doing CS50 from Harvard, but I've been a computer nerd for decades and I'm currently working towards a degree in Curitiba, Brazil. I also have a degree in music production where I graduated as top of my class ðŸŽº

I am currently focusing on developing web apps as fullstack web developer. I've got a good hang on Laravel and Django for backend development and with TailwindCSS for front-end tasks. I am also familiar, to a lesser degree, with C# and Java and I can also model and work with relational databases. ðŸ›«

At the time of writing, I am doing an internship were I build fullstack web applications with Laravel at a tech support sector in a national company. Parallel to my internship, I'm working on two personal projects using Django and and on a game on Godot with GDscript. Developing projects all hands on deck is my prefered way of learning ðŸ”¥
